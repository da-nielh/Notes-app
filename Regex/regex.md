# Regular expression (Regex)

A sequence of symbols and characters expressing a string or pattern to be searched from within a longer piece of text

- A regular expression (regex) defines a search pattern for strings.
- The search pattern can be anything from a simple character, a fixed string or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern.

## Why do we need Regex?

To use RegEx, we need three things.

- The first one is the text that we do the search on.
- The second is the pattern that we use to search
- The third one, a way to do the matching/searching
